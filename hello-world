**"Hello, world!"** is often the first program many people write when learning to code. It's a simple program that outputs the phrase *"Hello, world!"* to the screen or console. This tradition dates back to the early days of computer programming and serves as a way for beginners to get their feet wet and see immediate results.

The significance of *"Hello, world!"* lies in its simplicity and universality. It introduces fundamental concepts like writing code, compiling or interpreting it, and seeing the output. It's like the ABCs of programmingâ€”a basic starting point that helps newcomers understand the structure and syntax of a programming language.

Beyond its educational value, *"Hello, world!"* also symbolizes the connection between a programmer and the computer. With just a few lines of code, you can make the computer do something, and *"Hello, world!"* is often the first step in that journey. So, in essence, it's a humble yet powerful beginning in the vast world of coding.
